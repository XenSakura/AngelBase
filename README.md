# KitsuneEngine
a 3d Vulkan game engine build from the ground up for multithreaded purposes with dedicated editors

##Building this project
This project uses CMake and is intended to be a cross-platform game engine, hence the use of cross-platform libraries such as Vulkan. To build this project, get the CMake-gui, and select the source directory as the root directory. Create a build folder, and use that to compile your builds. Solution files will be generated for each individual computer-- but general structure will remain the same across multiple computers.

##Use cases
This project is intended to be a commercial use engine

##Credits
This project is led by Sakura Shih and Amy Ackermann. More contributors will be added here as time moves on.
